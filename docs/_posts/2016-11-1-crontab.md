#### What is Cron
Cron is a system utility in unix-like operating systems used to execute tasks based on a schedule.
Cron reads a users Crontab (cron table) and executes the tasks at set times as listed in the crontab file.

#### Editing your Crontab

The Crontab file is best accessed via the terminal as this prevents corruption (txt edit programs can cause the crontab file to become corrupted).
After opening a terminal I recommend executing the command: `export EDITOR=nano`  
This changes your default terminal text editor to nano instead of vi as nano is a lot easier to use (in my opinion).

Next execute `crontab -e`  
This will open your crontab file in nano and allow you to insert your own commands.

#### Crontab Syntax

The syntax that cron uses is not exactly designed to be easily read by people.

This is the basic idea to writing a crontab command.  
`minute(0-59) hour(0-23) day(1-31) month(1-12) weekday (0-6) /usr/bin/somedirectory/somecommand`  
Each command in the file requires minutes, hours, days, month and weekday entries. If one is missing the command won't be executed.

Below are a couple of examples as found on the [ubuntu crontab page](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CronHowto). Be sure to check out their page for a more through look at cron and crontab.

`01 04 1 1 1 /usr/bin/somedirectory/somecommand`  
The above example will run /usr/bin/somedirectory/somecommand at 4:01am on January 1st plus every Monday in January.

An asterisk (\*) can be used so that every instance (every hour, every weekday, every month, etc.) of a time period is used.  
`01 04 * * * /usr/bin/somedirectory/somecommand`  
The above example will run /usr/bin/somedirectory/somecommand at 4:01am on every day of every month.

It is also possible to use commas `15,20`  `on the 15th or the 20th` and dashes `5-12`  `between the 5th and the 12th`.
