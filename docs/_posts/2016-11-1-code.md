#### Title

For simplicity, the code on Brian's PIIRRI is series of shell commands stored in a .py file.
When Cron opens the file, pinPassOn.py, it executes a bash command to turn on the GPio pin that crontab specified.
Similarly, pinPassoff.py, turns off the GPio pin.
Both executables echo a statment along the lines of `Pin x set to on/off` which is written to a log file using cron.

##### [pinPassOn.py](https://github.com/FabLabWgtn/PIIRRI/blob/master/code/pinPassOn.py)

```shell
#!/bin/bash
gpio write $1 1
echo -n "Pin" $1 "set to ON. "
date
```

##### [pinPassOn.py](https://github.com/FabLabWgtn/PIIRRI/blob/master/code/pinPassOff.py)

```shell
#!/bin/bash
gpio write $1 0
echo -n "Pin" $1 "set to OFF. "
date
```
