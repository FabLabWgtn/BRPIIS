#### No Dust Here - A project for all Raspberry Pi's gathering dust, by Brain in Adelaide.
This site is the Documentation for a project started by Brian in Adelaide. He, like many others, purchased a Raspberry Pi after seeing it was a simple, cost effective way to enter into the programmable computing world. And like many others, Brian found that shortly after the excitement of purchasing such a interesting, "useful" device it was put away and left to gather dust.
After seeing this happen Brian decided it was time to put the Pi to use and shortly thereafter the Raspberry Pi Irrigation System was born.
